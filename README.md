# [Marina Bay Fireworks Viewpoints]

Marina Bay Fireworks Viewpoints is a small web tool that displays photographic vantage points around the Marina Bay area, 
focusing specifically on the fireworks barge at the center of the Bay. 
This is pretty useful for big public holidays such as National Day or New Year's.

All photographs were taken by me using a Nikon D7000, with an 11-16mm lens.

This was built in a few hours using the Google Maps and Static Maps API. The most time-consuming part of development was
creating the data objects that tied the photos with geo-coordinates.
